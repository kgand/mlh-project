# Function to preprocess network data (simplified example)
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Perform feature extraction, normalization, and cleaning as needed
    # Example: Extract relevant features from the network packet
    features = extract_features(data)

    # Normalize the features
    normalized_features = normalize_features(features)

    return normalized_features

# Example functions (you need to implement these):
def extract_features(data):
    # Implement feature extraction logic
    pass

def normalize_features(features):
    # Implement feature normalization logic
    pass
